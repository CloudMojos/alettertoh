    <div class="letter">In CSS Grid Layout, justify-content and justify-items are two properties that are used to align the items within a grid container. justify-content is used to align the grid items along the main axis of the grid container, which is the horizontal axis by default. This means that if you use justify-content: center, for example, the grid items will be centered horizontally within the grid container. justify-items, on the other hand, is used to align the grid items along the inline axis of each grid item. This is the horizontal axis by default, but it can be changed to the vertical axis using the writing-mode property. So, if you use justify-items: center, for example, the grid items will be centered horizontally within each grid cell, regardless of the direction of the main axis of the grid container. In summary, justify-content is used to align grid items along the main axis of the grid container, while justify-items is used to align grid items within each grid cell along the inline axis.</div>
