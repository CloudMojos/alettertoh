    <p class="letter-salutation">Dear Hannah,</p>
    <br>
    <p class="letter-content">I hope you are doing great right now. Even though I just saw that you actually have a fever. I wish for your recovery.</p>
    <p class="letter-content">The first time we met this year was in March. I had no plan to add you to my facebook friends list that night but I just felt like I should, considering you were one of my good friends before. It was also nice to see a person, whose eyes widened when it met mine. You probably didn't notice but my eyes felt like it widened, too. You tried to give me a high five then. The first one landed miserably, so you tried it again. I stood there, not knowing what to do. Wondering if I will ever see you again.</p>

    <p class="letter-content">Months passed by and we still remained as good friends. I could've regretted my confession to you when I told you I have a crush on you, because I could've lost a friend that day. But I was glad that I didn't.</p>

    <p class="letter-content">You also were there, when it was my birthday. It was so random but I appreciate it.</p>

      <figcaption>What even is this?</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br>
    <p class="letter-content">Our constant ephemeral pranking with each other even resulted in you telling me you have a crush on me too. Even now I just couldn't believe it. Are you sure this wasn't a prank?</p>
    <br>
    <p class="letter-content">Nonetheless, I am glad that we started out as friends. In that way, even if things didn't work out (please lord, it's a jinx), we would still have the confidence to reach out to each other. You once told me you were afraid of us never talking to each other ever again.<br><br> That's silly. <br><br> You're far too important to me.<br><br> The only way to make that happen is if one of us dies ðŸ’€.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="letter-content">Excuse my dark jokes, I hope you don't mind. You can expect a lot more and a lot worse from me.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="letter-content">I once told you that I felt relieved that you didn't continue to travel to a foreign country. Oops. That's a red flag. But, please, hear me out. I want you to be happy. And if it means you have to go to another far away place, then you have my support. But I can't help but worry. If that was a red flag, then color me impressed (that's... that's not how that phrase works!)</p>
    <br>
    <p class="letter-content">You might be thinking, what's all this about? ðŸ¤” I don't know either. I can't come up with words to tell you how much I like you. And I also want to apologize.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="letter-content">I want to greet you Good Mornings and Good Nights but I don't know if you even want me to. It's probably just in my mind, but do you hate it? I mean, am I looking like a clingy person already? ðŸ˜¬ In a yes or no type of question, an answer that's not a yes is automatically a no, even if the answer was silence. It's also the same with this one. I have no way to know if the silence means "dude, this is my sign for you to stop", or "I am really busy, sorry". Either option is bad news for me. If it was the former, then it's a bit easier, 'cause then I would just stop. But if it was the latter, then I wouldn't know if I am being a nuisance if I continue to do what I was already doing. I know you never asked for me to do this in the first place, but I don't really want to be somebody who gets in your way. You have already done so much this year. Being a burden is really the last thing I want to be. I would also like to apologize because I put too much expectation on this one. I just realized that being alone in this house doesn't help either. So in turn I was placing too much of my social needs on you. That's not good. That's also one of the reasons why I decided to be out for the week, to check my brakes and engine, even though it lasted for a day. I don't know which direction we're going now. I never did. I don't even know if I am even on your to-do list with everything going on. I can help, you know? I hope you realize that. It's unfair that I am being like this with the things going on around you right now, I know. If you need a pause, like the cryosleep caskets in sci-fi films, if you need a pause from the things between us (if there is one), just let me know. I will not complain. Put me in the casket and revive me whenever you want.
    </p>

    <p>With valor and stupidity,</p>
